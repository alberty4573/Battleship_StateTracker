# Battleship_StateTracker
This is a small program for a single player Battleship game.

This game is a console game which only have a state tracker interface loaded in terminal.

It allows you to: 

● Create a board 
(Auto created a 10 * 10 board)

● Add a battleship to the board 
(3 preset battleships, first battleship is a bad data, and you can customise one if you want)

● Take an “attack” at a given position, and report back whether the attack resulted in a hit or a miss 
(It will ask you to input a coordinate to hit on board)

● Return whether the player has lost the game yet (i.e. all battleships are sunk)
(You have unlimited tries until the ship has been sunk, then you'll win the game)
